## Theme Variants

All themes come in both G1 and movie variants, but the cards allow for individual overrides.

### Applying a theme (and where the font lands)

Since `0.5.0` the themes use Home Assistant's native design tokens, so **card-mod is not
required** — see [Themes and card-mod](README.md#themes-and-card-mod).

**One view only** — the font applies to every card in that view and nothing else:

```yaml
views:
  - title: Cybertron
    theme: Transformers Dark (G1)
    cards: ...
```

**Whole UI** — Profile → *Theme* → pick a Transformers theme. Sidebar, dialogs and settings are
skinned too.

The tokens each theme sets:

| Token | Effect |
|---|---|
| `ha-font-family-body` | body text in every card |
| `ha-font-family-heading` | headings |
| `ha-font-family-longform` | long-form text (markdown cards) |
| `ha-card-header-font-family` | `ha-card` headers |
| `ha-card-border-width` / `ha-card-border-color` | 2px themed card border |
| `ha-card-box-shadow` | outer glow plus the 4px accent stripe down the left edge |
| `lovelace-background` | view backdrop (`TELETRAAN-I` image, Dirty Metal grime texture) |

Body text inside cards is handled by the bundled `transformers-theme-shim.js` resource, which the
integration registers for you — Home Assistant's own tokens do not reach inherited text. See
[Themes and card-mod](README.md#themes-and-card-mod).

Drop `ha-font-family-longform` from a theme if display-font markdown is hard to read; headings
stay Transformers.
